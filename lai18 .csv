48,0.001320833333,0.001380092593,賴清德,公益社會溫暖台灣的具體作法
49,0.001380092593,0.001414351852,賴清德,我們都非常清楚
50,0.001414351852,0.001477314815,賴清德,我們在經濟發展的過程當中
51,0.001477314815,0.001545833333,賴清德,同時也應該要藉由經濟的力量來照顧弱勢
52,0.001545833333,0.001602314815,賴清德,那過去這段時間我不斷地提出
53,0.001602314815,0.001643055556,賴清德,未來我將擴大社會的投資
54,0.001643055556,0.001679166667,賴清德,建立一個新的支持體系
55,0.001679166667,0.001713425926,賴清德,來達到全民照顧的社會
56,0.001713425926,0.001775,賴清德,如此公益的社會才有辦法達成
57,0.001775,0.001827777778,賴清德,因此我在這裡要向國人具體承諾
58,0.001827777778,0.001852314815,賴清德,如果我擔任總統
59,0.001852314815,0.001902314815,賴清德,未來我將定期的跟社福團體見面
60,0.001902314815,0.001968518519,賴清德,來聽聽社福團體所代表的心聲
61,0.001968518519,0.00200462963,賴清德,也藉由跟公益團體的合作
62,0.00200462963,0.002029166667,賴清德,能夠進一步的深化
63,0.002029166667,0.002066666667,賴清德,多弱勢朋友的照顧
64,0.002066666667,0.002118981481,賴清德,讓這個社會能夠達到公益的目標
65,0.002118981481,0.002149537037,賴清德,那為了要打造公益社會
66,0.002149537037,0.002180555556,賴清德,我有以下幾個具體方案
67,0.002180555556,0.002255555556,賴清德,第一個就是強化兒少保護及健康促進行動
68,0.002255555556,0.002312037037,賴清德,第二個是身心障礙者權益促進行動
69,0.002312037037,0.002362962963,賴清德,以及強化身心障礙者的社區支持
70,0.002362962963,0.002434259259,賴清德,第三個具體方案是建構友善自主的高齡生活環境
71,0.002434259259,0.002483333333,賴清德,第四個是推動社會安全網2.0
72,0.002483333333,0.002535648148,賴清德,第五個是強化保障經濟安全
73,0.002535648148,0.002588888889,賴清德,我會一一的向大家做詳細的報告
74,0.002588888889,0.002618055556,賴清德,就第一個具體方案而言
75,0.002618055556,0.0026625,賴清德,強化兒少保護及健康促進行動
76,0.0026625,0.002687962963,賴清德,將有幾個具體的做法
77,0.002687962963,0.002734722222,賴清德,第一個是將增進兒少生活協助
78,0.002734722222,0.00276712963,賴清德,以及健康維護
79,0.00276712963,0.002825,賴清德,具體的內容是協助地方政府建立單一窗口服務
80,0.002825,0.00285787037,賴清德,進行整合各項補助措施
81,0.00285787037,0.002902314815,賴清德,強化就學交通補助
82,0.002902314815,0.002925925926,賴清德,確保兒少不同生活階段
83,0.002925925926,0.002971759259,賴清德,都能夠獲得的基本經濟保障
84,0.002971759259,0.003024074074,賴清德,並由政府補助提供營養諮詢
85,0.003024074074,0.00304212963,賴清德,健康評估
86,0.00304212963,0.003101851852,賴清德,協助後續健康維護相關的服務轉介
87,0.003101851852,0.00316712963,賴清德,第二個具體做法是保障特殊境遇兒少權益
88,0.00316712963,0.003216203704,賴清德,適當延長替代性的照顧
89,0.003216203704,0.003253240741,賴清德,對依法安置是特殊境遇兒少
90,0.003253240741,0.003288425926,賴清德,我們必須要依個案需求
91,0.003288425926,0.003330555556,賴清德,給予延長安置的連線
92,0.003330555556,0.00335787037,賴清德,避免連線一到
93,0.00335787037,0.003400462963,賴清德,實際上他尚沒有具備獨立的能力
94,0.003400462963,0.003437037037,賴清德,衍生出許許多多的社會問題
95,0.003437037037,0.003477777778,賴清德,並且同步延長自立生活服務連線
96,0.003477777778,0.003505092593,賴清德,以保障有需求個案
97,0.003505092593,0.003584722222,賴清德,能夠得到過渡至成年前期所需的協助跟支援
98,0.003584722222,0.003641666667,賴清德,這些無非都是要讓特殊境遇的兒少
99,0.003641666667,0.003679166667,賴清德,能夠逐步成為獨立的個體
100,0.003679166667,0.003722685185,賴清德,能夠過自己的生活
101,0.003722685185,0.003763425926,賴清德,那第三個具體做法是
102,0.003763425926,0.003818055556,賴清德,年輕族群心理健康支持方案
103,0.003818055556,0.003858796296,賴清德,要向下延伸至小學
104,0.003858796296,0.003915277778,賴清德,社會經濟發展越來越好
105,0.003915277778,0.003945833333,賴清德,競爭也越來越強
106,0.003945833333,0.00396712963,賴清德,在這種狀況之下
107,0.00396712963,0.004006018519,賴清德,人際的關係越來越疏離
108,0.004006018519,0.00403287037,賴清德,有時候親子的關係
109,0.00403287037,0.004063888889,賴清德,也有許多要加強的地方
110,0.004063888889,0.004101851852,賴清德,那現在的孩子壓力特別大
111,0.004101851852,0.004174074074,賴清德,心理的支持非常需要社會給予幫助
112,0.004174074074,0.004191203704,賴清德,在這種狀況之下
113,0.004191203704,0.004233333333,賴清德,我們鼓勵遭遇心理困境的兒少
114,0.004233333333,0.004258796296,賴清德,能夠勇於協助
115,0.004258796296,0.004293981481,賴清德,協助認識與善用心理諮商
116,0.004293981481,0.00432037037,賴清德,並及時找出高風險個案
117,0.00432037037,0.004344444444,賴清德,加以預防處理
118,0.004344444444,0.004402777778,賴清德,避免釀成更大的事件
119,0.004402777778,0.004424537037,賴清德,下一個具體的做法是
120,0.004424537037,0.00445787037,賴清德,推動學生輔導法修法
121,0.00445787037,0.004496296296,賴清德,以落實三級輔導的機制
122,0.004496296296,0.004543981481,賴清德,我們要落實發展展性輔導
123,0.004543981481,0.004572685185,賴清德,我們要落實發展性輔導
124,0.004572685185,0.004595833333,賴清德,介入性輔導
125,0.004595833333,0.004648148148,賴清德,以及處亦性輔導之三級輔導機制
126,0.004648148148,0.004701851852,賴清德,目前在地方執行的單位
127,0.004701851852,0.004739351852,賴清德,有包括教育機關 好比學校
128,0.004739351852,0.004756481481,賴清德,也有地方政府
129,0.004756481481,0.004784722222,賴清德,好比縣市政府鄉鎮公所
130,0.004784722222,0.004818518519,賴清德,即使彼此的整合
131,0.004818518519,0.004838425926,賴清德,還需要強化
132,0.004838425926,0.004891666667,賴清德,而且最主要的是人力物力也相對匱乏
133,0.004891666667,0.004906944444,賴清德,在這種狀況之下
134,0.004906944444,0.004971296296,賴清德,未來中央政府將會積極的協助
135,0.004971296296,0.004996759259,賴清德,各種資源的投注
136,0.004996759259,0.005043055556,賴清德,讓年輕族群的心理健康支持方案
137,0.005043055556,0.005065740741,賴清德,能夠更加的落實
138,0.005065740741,0.005093518519,賴清德,也讓三級的輔導機制
139,0.005093518519,0.005121296296,賴清德,能夠確實執行
140,0.005121296296,0.005133796296,賴清德,那最後一個就是
141,0.005133796296,0.005179166667,賴清德,廣泛提供兒少身心發展的運動
142,0.005179166667,0.005202777778,賴清德,及遊樂場所
143,0.005202777778,0.005237962963,賴清德,我們要擴大公營風景區
144,0.005237962963,0.005271296296,賴清德,及文教設施
145,0.005271296296,0.005314351852,賴清德,特定日期免費入場等措施
146,0.005314351852,0.005366203704,賴清德,目前已經有開始在進行
147,0.005366203704,0.005410185185,賴清德,但未來我們希望能夠擴大來落實
148,0.005410185185,0.005462037037,賴清德,並且能夠增加兒少可近用的活動空間
149,0.005462037037,0.005486111111,賴清德,他可能是公園
150,0.005486111111,0.005527314815,賴清德,或是可能是各種開放的空間
151,0.005527314815,0.005565740741,賴清德,我們都可以讓他能夠成為
152,0.005565740741,0.005622685185,賴清德,適合兒少身心發展的運動及遊樂場所
153,0.005622685185,0.005672222222,賴清德,那第二個具體的措施
154,0.005672222222,0.005723148148,賴清德,具體方案就是身心障礙者的權益促進行動
155,0.005723148148,0.005756944444,賴清德,這個也有以下幾點具體作法
156,0.005756944444,0.005771296296,賴清德,那麼第一個呢
157,0.005771296296,0.00582962963,賴清德,我們勢必要更加具體的參考
158,0.00582962963,0.005871296296,賴清德,聯合國身心障礙者權利公約
159,0.005871296296,0.005905092593,賴清德,促進無障礙環境
160,0.005905092593,0.005946759259,賴清德,那我們很清楚台灣在2014年
161,0.005946759259,0.005989814815,賴清德,有兒童權利公約已經入法
162,0.005989814815,0.006040740741,賴清德,在身心障礙者權利公約也已經入法
163,0.006040740741,0.006077777778,賴清德,所以不管是兒童的兒少的權益
164,0.006077777778,0.006125462963,賴清德,或是若是身心障礙者的權益的促進行動
165,0.006125462963,0.006165740741,賴清德,我們都應該更加積極的來落實
166,0.006165740741,0.006186574074,賴清德,有幾個具體的作法
167,0.006186574074,0.006240740741,賴清德,第一個就是改善各項公眾使用措施

362,0.01483796296,0.01487268519,吳玉琴,公益社會溫暖台灣的這個主軸
363,0.01487268519,0.01491898148,吳玉琴,那我想民進黨執政七年來
364,0.01491898148,0.01493055556,吳玉琴,七年半來
365,0.01493055556,0.01497685185,吳玉琴,其實真的完成了非常多的社會福利
366,0.01497685185,0.01498842593,吳玉琴,不可能的任務
367,0.01498842593,0.01501157407,吳玉琴,這樣的一個任務
368,0.01501157407,0.01503472222,吳玉琴,包括我們推出了長照2.0
369,0.01503472222,0.01506944444,吳玉琴,當然賴副總統也提出了長照3.0
370,0.01506944444,0.01509259259,吳玉琴,那社安網的2.0
371,0.01509259259,0.01513888889,吳玉琴,還有我們很多的這個社會住宅的一個新建
372,0.01513888889,0.01517361111,吳玉琴,以及給付C肝的口服藥
373,0.01517361111,0.01520833333,吳玉琴,啟動了住院的一個整合照顧
374,0.01520833333,0.01523148148,吳玉琴,以及在宅醫療
375,0.01523148148,0.01525462963,吳玉琴,我們在這七年半來
376,0.01525462963,0.01528935185,吳玉琴,其實完成了20年來延宕的一些修法
377,0.01528935185,0.0153125,吳玉琴,包括俗稱的醫糾法
378,0.0153125,0.0153587963,吳玉琴,就是醫療事故預防及處理法
379,0.0153587963,0.01538194444,吳玉琴,還有我們社會福利基本法
380,0.01538194444,0.01543981481,吳玉琴,這些立法工作都是在20年來的一個努力才完成
381,0.01543981481,0.01546296296,吳玉琴,那另外我們在這段期間
382,0.01546296296,0.01549768519,吳玉琴,其實也積極的回應社會的一個問題
383,0.01549768519,0.01554398148,吳玉琴,還有需求像適應私密影像的一個修法
384,0.01554398148,0.0155787037,吳玉琴,釋法 還有性騷擾的三法
385,0.0155787037,0.015625,吳玉琴,那大家覺得這個事情好像很容易
386,0.015625,0.01563657407,吳玉琴,事實上在立法院
387,0.01563657407,0.0156712963,吳玉琴,這釋法聯合的修法
388,0.0156712963,0.01571759259,吳玉琴,以及性騷擾三法的整個的一個修法
389,0.01571759259,0.01574074074,吳玉琴,其實是花費很大的一個力氣
390,0.01574074074,0.01576388889,吳玉琴,大家一起共同討論
391,0.01576388889,0.01581018519,吳玉琴,那這三年來其實也又遇到我們的疫情
392,0.01581018519,0.01583333333,吳玉琴,所以其實我們的修法
393,0.01583333333,0.01586805556,吳玉琴,或是我們的政策都沒有耽擱
394,0.01586805556,0.01591435185,吳玉琴,那我們今天可以看到我們賴副總統的政見裡面
395,0.01591435185,0.01597222222,吳玉琴,這些政見其實是邀請了非常多的學者專家參與
396,0.01597222222,0.01600694444,吳玉琴,我要特別謝謝賴副總統這半年來
397,0.01600694444,0.01604166667,吳玉琴,其實跟我們的兒少婦 老障
398,0.01604166667,0.01611111111,吳玉琴,還有社宅以及遊民跟食物銀行的這些相關的領域的團體
399,0.01611111111,0.01615740741,吳玉琴,都有很長的一個面對面的一個座談
400,0.01615740741,0.01618055556,吳玉琴,特別要謝謝在8月28號
401,0.01618055556,0.01622685185,吳玉琴,我們有跟社福賴在一起的一個見面會活動
402,0.01622685185,0.01625,吳玉琴,賴副總統坐在下面
403,0.01625,0.01628472222,吳玉琴,聆聽19位食物工作者
404,0.01628472222,0.01633101852,吳玉琴,一起對於社福的一個國政的意見
405,0.01633101852,0.01637731481,吳玉琴,他一一聆聽 一一的記錄下來
406,0.01637731481,0.01642361111,吳玉琴,而且還承諾要跟我們社福團體定期的見面
407,0.01642361111,0.01644675926,吳玉琴,可以來聆聽大家的聲音
408,0.01644675926,0.01649305556,吳玉琴,我想他的誠意以及他的對於社福的一個重視
409,0.01649305556,0.0165162037,吳玉琴,從這邊都可以看得出來
410,0.0165162037,0.0165625,吳玉琴,那我想這七年來我們民進黨的一個食物的執政經驗
411,0.0165625,0.01659722222,吳玉琴,再加上民間食物工作的一個
412,0.01659722222,0.01662037037,吳玉琴,跟食物工作者的一個緊密合作
413,0.01662037037,0.01667824074,吳玉琴,我相信賴副總統今天提出來的這個社福的國政藍圖
414,0.01667824074,0.01672453704,吳玉琴,是所有候選人裡面是絕對具體可行
415,0.01672453704,0.01675925926,吳玉琴,而且這個整個涵蓋面是最廣的
416,0.01675925926,0.01680555556,吳玉琴,那我想剛提到的社會安全網裡面
417,0.01680555556,0.0168287037,吳玉琴,要把它常態化
418,0.0168287037,0.01686342593,吳玉琴,還有我們的聲音障礙的相關的一個
419,0.01686342593,0.01688657407,吳玉琴,這個聲權公約
420,0.01688657407,0.0169212963,吳玉琴,還有我們心智障礙者的一個照顧
421,0.0169212963,0.01697916667,吳玉琴,以及老人走出來的一個交通的可近性
422,0.01697916667,0.01700231481,吳玉琴,孤獨老的議題的被重視
423,0.01700231481,0.01704861111,吳玉琴,還有我們社會整個兒少老婦的一個
424,0.01704861111,0.01708333333,吳玉琴,身障的一個通用設計的環境
425,0.01708333333,0.01711805556,吳玉琴,特別是最後修改社會救助法
426,0.01711805556,0.01716435185,吳玉琴,我想這個也是我們接下來一個下一個階段的社福
427,0.01716435185,0.0171875,吳玉琴,非常重要的一個修法
428,0.0171875,0.0172337963,吳玉琴,怎麼樣讓這個邊緣戶或甚至低收入戶的部分
429,0.0172337963,0.01725694444,吳玉琴,可以擴大照顧的層面
430,0.01725694444,0.01730324074,吳玉琴,我相信賴副總統在他的帶領下
431,0.01730324074,0.01734953704,吳玉琴,接下來我們的一個這個賴副總統的總統任期
432,0.01734953704,0.01737268519,吳玉琴,接下來這一棒
433,0.01737268519,0.01739583333,吳玉琴,一定可以跟我們民間團體
434,0.01739583333,0.01741898148,吳玉琴,結合民間團體的力量
435,0.01741898148,0.01746527778,吳玉琴,我們一起讓有需要支持的人都可以得到支持
436,0.01746527778,0.01748842593,吳玉琴,讓每一個人不漏接
437,0.01748842593,0.01751157407,吳玉琴,讓我們的社會更溫暖
438,0.01751157407,0.01753472222,吳玉琴,讓我們的社會更有溫度
439,0.01753472222,0.01758101852,吳玉琴,我相信賴副總統接下來的總統的一個任期
440,0.01758101852,0.01760416667,吳玉琴,一定可以把這些任務完成
441,0.01760416667,0.01763888889,吳玉琴,我要特別謝謝代表社福團體
442,0.01763888889,0.01767361111,吳玉琴,我們很希望跟賴副總統一起工作
443,0.01767361111,0.01771990741,吳玉琴,一個新的政府也能夠跟民間一起攜手往前走
444,0.01771990741,0.0177662037,吳玉琴,我相信民間會是政府非常大的一個支持的後盾
445,0.0177662037,0.01778935185,吳玉琴,我們一起努力謝謝
446,0.01778935185,0.01780092593,主持人,謝謝委員的鼓勵
447,0.01780092593,0.01784722222,主持人,剛才特別提到8月18號的座談會期間的與會貴賓
448,0.01784722222,0.01788194444,主持人,在當天的社福團體都給了我們很多寶貴的建言
449,0.01788194444,0.01790509259,主持人,也謝謝今天再度與會來到我們的記者會
450,0.01790509259,0.01793981481,主持人,接下來要進行的是時事的QA題
451,0.01793981481,0.01797453704,主持人,我們邀請賴清德總統候選人能夠就位
452,0.01797453704,0.01798611111,主持人,各位媒體朋友們
453,0.01798611111,0.01802083333,主持人,我們今天還是希望大家優先能夠先問
454,0.01802083333,0.01804398148,主持人,跟今天主題相關的政見
455,0.01804398148,0.01806712963,主持人,首先第一位
456,0.01806712963,0.01809027778,主持人,中央社素萍
457,0.01809027778,0.01819444444,記者,主席你剛剛有提到那個年青族群心理健康支持方案
458,0.01819444444,0.01821759259,記者,要向下延伸到小學
459,0.01821759259,0.01825231481,記者,因為這個方案其實是8月才上路
460,0.01825231481,0.01831018519,記者,然後它的那個成效其實評估我們還看不出來
461,0.01831018519,0.01833333333,記者,因為我看到好像有一些塞車
462,0.01833333333,0.01836805556,記者,譬如說大家預約不到心理諮商
463,0.01836805556,0.01840277778,記者,那就是在成效還沒有出來之前
464,0.01840277778,0.01842592593,記者,就是我們就已經要向下延伸的考量是什麼
465,0.01842592593,0.01844907407,記者,為什麼是向下不是向上
466,0.01844907407,0.01851851852,記者,因為青年的那個30歲以上的人也蠻鬱悶的
467,0.01851851852,0.01855324074,記者,然後另外一個就是說
468,0.01855324074,0.01857638889,記者,因為最近大家在講不分區
469,0.01857638889,0.01861111111,記者,然後去上這一屆的第一名是吳玉琴委員
470,0.01861111111,0.01866898148,記者,因為那時候好像政府是要強調我們重視社福
471,0.01866898148,0.01869212963,記者,那我們也蠻關心不分區
472,0.01869212963,0.01872685185,記者,那社福這次是不是也有可能列第一
473,0.01872685185,0.01877314815,賴清德,好謝謝
474,0.01877314815,0.0187962963,賴清德,就是素萍剛剛講的
475,0.0187962963,0.01881944444,賴清德,就是8月份上路
476,0.01881944444,0.01885416667,賴清德,那就有許多人
477,0.01885416667,0.01892361111,賴清德,也有希望藉這樣的一個管道來解決自己的需求
478,0.01892361111,0.01895833333,賴清德,所以我們也看出這個方向
479,0.01895833333,0.01905092593,賴清德,所以我們優先要來規劃向下延伸到小學
480,0.01905092593,0.01908564815,賴清德,那當然目前在進行
481,0.01908564815,0.01914351852,賴清德,譬如說你剛剛講的供不應求的問題
482,0.01914351852,0.01916666667,賴清德,這個我們會來解決
483,0.01916666667,0.01921296296,賴清德,另外我們在這個報告裡面
484,0.01921296296,0.01927083333,賴清德,也會成立100個社區服務據點
485,0.01927083333,0.01934027778,賴清德,也許有一個專業的專線或是目前的做法
486,0.01934027778,0.01938657407,賴清德,那如果能夠社區這一部分也能夠來強化的話
487,0.01938657407,0.0194212963,賴清德,我相信會更周延
488,0.0194212963,0.01945601852,賴清德,那第二個就是上一次的記者會
489,0.01945601852,0.01947916667,賴清德,有記者朋友問我說
490,0.01947916667,0.01950231481,賴清德,有沒有體育界的不分區
491,0.01950231481,0.01954861111,賴清德,今天你問我說有沒有社福界的不分區
492,0.01954861111,0.01960648148,賴清德,那我希望社會能夠多多支持民進黨
493,0.01960648148,0.0196412037,賴清德,讓民進黨的不分區能夠有更多席
494,0.0196412037,0.0196875,賴清德,涵蓋各領域優秀的人才
495,0.0196875,0.01971064815,賴清德,那只要優秀的人才
496,0.01971064815,0.01975694444,賴清德,那我們的提名小組應該都會很歡迎
497,0.01975694444,0.01978009259,賴清德,當然我再強調
498,0.01978009259,0.01983796296,賴清德,非常希望我們全國的民眾政黨票能夠投民進黨
499,0.01983796296,0.01987268519,賴清德,讓民進黨能夠為國家社會
500,0.01987268519,0.01989583333,賴清德,招募更多的人才
501,0.01989583333,0.01991898148,賴清德,一起工作一起服務
502,0.01991898148,0.0199537037,主持人,好 繼續 媒體朋友們
503,0.0199537037,0.01997685185,主持人,台視承哲
504,0.01997685185,0.0200462963,記者,賴副想請教一下
505,0.0200462963,0.02006944444,記者,這個民進黨立委趙天麟
506,0.02006944444,0.02009259259,記者,在近坦承有婚外情的情況
507,0.02009259259,0.02010416667,記者,那想請教一下
508,0.02010416667,0.02012731481,記者,只是依黨內的規定
509,0.02012731481,0.02016203704,記者,我們會希望他退選嗎 謝謝
510,0.02016203704,0.02019675926,賴清德,當事人自己的事情有責任
511,0.02019675926,0.02024305556,賴清德,對家庭還有對社會說明清楚
512,0.02024305556,0.02027777778,賴清德,這個是他無可迴避的責任
513,0.02027777778,0.02030092593,賴清德,好
514,0.02030092593,0.02034722222,主持人,還有媒體朋友們是不是還有相關的提問
515,0.02034722222,0.02037037037,主持人,東森燕慈
516,0.02037037037,0.02043981481,主持人,抱歉 東森新聞雲 燕慈
517,0.02043981481,0.02047453704,記者,主席想請教
518,0.02047453704,0.02049768519,記者,因為桃色緋聞連環爆
519,0.02049768519,0.02050925926,記者,除了趙天麟之外
520,0.02050925926,0.02053240741,記者,網路也傳出就是鄭文燦
521,0.02053240741,0.02054398148,記者,她好像有一個影片
522,0.02054398148,0.02056712963,記者,和妙齡女子出入飯店
523,0.02056712963,0.02060185185,記者,那會覺得這可能跟中共介選有關係嗎
524,0.02060185185,0.02063657407,記者,還是我們要怎麼樣為選情來止血
525,0.02063657407,0.02068287037,賴清德,此刻不宜多加揣測啦
526,0.02068287037,0.02071759259,賴清德,我覺得當事人有責任
527,0.02071759259,0.02074074074,賴清德,對外說明清楚
528,0.02074074074,0.02078703704,賴清德,沒有人有辦法替他們說明
529,0.02078703704,0.02081018519,賴清德,這是他們的責任
530,0.02081018519,0.02084490741,主持人,好 繼續 山林淑君
531,0.02086805556,0.02090277778,主持人,我們稍後即將開放最後一題
532,0.02090277778,0.02092592593,記者,賴副這邊想要請教說
533,0.02092592593,0.0209375,記者,前幾天你有提到說
534,0.0209375,0.02096064815,記者,中國不要每到選舉
535,0.02096064815,0.0209837963,記者,就有動作要逼台商表態
536,0.0209837963,0.02101851852,記者,郭振英說這是在操弄兩岸議題
537,0.02101851852,0.02104166667,記者,那藍白陣營對富士康查稅的問題
538,0.02104166667,0.02106481481,記者,也沒有多做說明
539,0.02106481481,0.02108796296,記者,你怎麼看 你認為原因是什麼
540,0.02108796296,0.02112268519,記者,另外對認為說中共介選會花招越來越多
541,0.02112268519,0.02116898148,記者,對您的選情會不會有所影響 謝謝
542,0.02116898148,0.0212037037,賴清德,其實我是語重心長
543,0.0212037037,0.02125,賴清德,要呼籲中國
544,0.02125,0.02130787037,賴清德,要愛護珍惜台商
545,0.02130787037,0.02134259259,賴清德,因為台商是台灣的資產
546,0.02134259259,0.02136574074,賴清德,台商到中國投資
547,0.02136574074,0.02141203704,賴清德,固然台商因此可以賺到錢
548,0.02141203704,0.02144675926,賴清德,但是同時也幫了中國
549,0.02144675926,0.02148148148,賴清德,經濟的推升產業的發展
550,0.02148148148,0.02150462963,賴清德,創造那麼多個工作機會
551,0.02150462963,0.02153935185,賴清德,讓中國社會能夠安定
552,0.02153935185,0.02158564815,賴清德,其實台商對中國的貢獻很大
553,0.02158564815,0.02163194444,賴清德,這是水幫魚 魚幫水
554,0.02163194444,0.02165509259,賴清德,是雙贏的局面
555,0.02165509259,0.02170138889,賴清德,中國不必要選舉的時候
556,0.02170138889,0.02172453704,賴清德,就對台商施加壓力
557,0.02172453704,0.02174768519,賴清德,要求台商表態
558,0.02174768519,0.02179398148,賴清德,甚至要求台商直接支持
559,0.02179398148,0.0218287037,賴清德,他們所設定的候選人
560,0.0218287037,0.02188657407,賴清德,因為這是一個兩敗俱傷的手法
561,0.02188657407,0.02194444444,賴清德,因為台商受到無辜的波及
562,0.02194444444,0.02196759259,賴清德,會失去對中國的信心
563,0.02196759259,0.02201388889,賴清德,一旦台商擔心害怕
564,0.02201388889,0.02204861111,賴清德,失去對中國的信任
565,0.02204861111,0.02209490741,賴清德,逐步的移往其他的國家
566,0.02209490741,0.02212962963,賴清德,另立生產的據點
567,0.02212962963,0.02217592593,賴清德,對中國也是一大損失
568,0.02217592593,0.0222337963,賴清德,另外一點我也要呼籲中國
569,0.0222337963,0.02231481481,賴清德,就是要尊重台灣民主自由的憲政體制
570,0.02231481481,0.02237268519,賴清德,要尊重台灣人民的生活方式
571,0.02237268519,0.02243055556,賴清德,特別是總統跟立委的大選
572,0.02243055556,0.02247685185,賴清德,要尊重台灣人民的自由意志
573,0.02247685185,0.0225462963,賴清德,來選出最適當最理想的總統
574,0.0225462963,0.02259259259,賴清德,由總統組織負責任的團隊
575,0.02259259259,0.02262731481,賴清德,來推動國家社會進步
576,0.02262731481,0.02267361111,賴清德,中國應該要把頭抬起來
577,0.02267361111,0.02269675926,賴清德,看一看
578,0.02269675926,0.02274305556,賴清德,國共內戰的歷史已經結束了
579,0.02274305556,0.02284722222,賴清德,應該由過去敵對對戰對抗的年代
580,0.02284722222,0.02296296296,賴清德,走向對等尊嚴對話交流的時代
581,0.02296296296,0.02299768519,賴清德,要創造雙贏
582,0.02299768519,0.02304398148,賴清德,我已經多次公開講過
583,0.02304398148,0.0230787037,賴清德,跟台灣人民承諾
584,0.0230787037,0.023125,賴清德,也跟國際社會包括中國在內
585,0.023125,0.02320601852,賴清德,我的使命就是維持現狀
586,0.02320601852,0.02325231481,賴清德,穩定台海的發展
587,0.02325231481,0.02329861111,賴清德,以及印太的和平
588,0.02329861111,0.02333333333,賴清德,只要對等尊嚴
589,0.02333333333,0.0234375,賴清德,未來我溝通交流的門永遠都是開的
590,0.0234375,0.02350694444,賴清德,中國應該要站在兩岸人民的福祉的立場上面
591,0.02350694444,0.02355324074,賴清德,應該要改變過去
592,0.02355324074,0.02358796296,賴清德,一直到現在
593,0.02358796296,0.02366898148,賴清德,這種損人不利己的做法
,,,賴清德,好謝謝大家謝謝
594,0.02366898148,0.0237037037,主持人,最後一題 工商學會
595,0.0237037037,0.02373842593,主持人,想問一下主席
596,0.02373842593,0.02378472222,主持人,有關社會安全網的這個部分
597,0.02378472222,0.02380787037,主持人,貧窮縣的這個定義
598,0.02380787037,0.02383101852,主持人,未來在你當選之後
599,0.02383101852,0.02388888889,主持人,你是不是認為有必要可以修法再放寬
600,0.02388888889,0.02392361111,主持人,來照顧更多的中低收入戶的弱勢
601,0.02392361111,0.02395833333,主持人,剛剛行的部分
602,0.02395833333,0.02398148148,主持人,主席你有提到嗎
603,0.02398148148,0.02400462963,主持人,但是住的部分
604,0.02400462963,0.02403935185,主持人,你說未來我們可不可能把社會住宅
605,0.02403935185,0.0240625,主持人,提撥一部分的比例
606,0.0240625,0.02412037037,主持人,來作為高齡者或弱勢者居住所用
607,0.02412037037,0.02415509259,主持人,或者說你認為有沒有必要
608,0.02415509259,0.02423611111,主持人,提出一個高齡友善住宅的政策 謝謝
609,0.02423611111,0.02425925926,賴清德,謝謝
610,0.02425925926,0.02428240741,賴清德,因為我在基層服務多年
611,0.02428240741,0.02430555556,賴清德,不管是當立委或是當市長
612,0.02430555556,0.02434027778,賴清德,其實我是看到基層弱勢的民眾
613,0.02434027778,0.02438657407,賴清德,不管是低收入戶 中低收入戶 邊緣戶等等
614,0.02438657407,0.0244212963,賴清德,生活上是相對困難
615,0.0244212963,0.02446759259,賴清德,所以當台灣的總體經濟在進步
616,0.02446759259,0.02451388889,賴清德,平均收入也有逐步在提升的時候
617,0.02451388889,0.02457175926,賴清德,那另外生活的所需也在逐漸提高
618,0.02457175926,0.0246412037,賴清德,我們是有必要與時俱進的檢討貧窮縣
619,0.0246412037,0.0246875,賴清德,那第二個更重要的是認定問題
620,0.0246875,0.02472222222,賴清德,因為目前的社會救助法
621,0.02472222222,0.02474537037,賴清德,做了相關的規定
622,0.02474537037,0.02476851852,賴清德,在執行面上
623,0.02476851852,0.02487268519,賴清德,如果地方政府沒有採取比較彈性的做法
624,0.02487268519,0.02491898148,賴清德,而是站在比較保守的角度來看社會救助法
625,0.02491898148,0.02496527778,賴清德,其實政府的美意常常難以落實
626,0.02496527778,0.02498842593,賴清德,我剛剛特別提到
627,0.02498842593,0.02502314815,賴清德,因為女兒已經嫁出去了
628,0.02502314815,0.02505787037,賴清德,女兒夫家的財產
629,0.02505787037,0.02510416667,賴清德,怎麼能夠計入娘家 父母親
630,0.02510416667,0.02519675926,賴清德,是不是有資格成為低收入戶 中低收入戶計算的標準呢
631,0.02519675926,0.02523148148,賴清德,所以我以前在當立委的時候
632,0.02523148148,0.02525462963,賴清德,有修改社會救助法
633,0.02525462963,0.02528935185,賴清德,新增一款就是要事實認定
634,0.02528935185,0.0253125,賴清德,事實認定
635,0.0253125,0.02534722222,賴清德,另外除了女兒這一個事件
636,0.02534722222,0.02538194444,賴清德,在各地常常出現以外
637,0.02538194444,0.02540509259,賴清德,也有一些家庭
638,0.02540509259,0.02545138889,賴清德,她有房子 她自己居住
639,0.02545138889,0.02553240741,賴清德,可是那個房子房貸也差不多是那個房子的錢
640,0.02553240741,0.02556712963,賴清德,或者是說她有土地
641,0.02556712963,0.02560185185,賴清德,可是那個土地是公共設施保留地
642,0.02560185185,0.02563657407,賴清德,銀行借不到錢也賣不出去
643,0.02563657407,0.02568287037,賴清德,也沒有目前公定價格的價值
644,0.02568287037,0.02571759259,賴清德,其實我覺得這一些細節
645,0.02571759259,0.02576388889,賴清德,常常影響社會救助法的美意
646,0.02576388889,0.02581018519,賴清德,這個是執行者本身必須要去調整的
647,0.02581018519,0.02585648148,賴清德,所以我們今天強調執行面
648,0.02585648148,0.02590277778,賴清德,我們願意在母法上面
649,0.02590277778,0.0259375,賴清德,做一個更明確的規定
650,0.0259375,0.02599537037,賴清德,讓第一線執行的政府機關的同仁
651,0.02599537037,0.02606481481,賴清德,能夠更妥善的去照顧需要照顧的人
652,0.02606481481,0.02612268519,賴清德,另外你說到這個老人住宅的這個問題
653,0.02612268519,0.02615740741,賴清德,因為我們現在社會住宅
654,0.02615740741,0.02623842593,賴清德,就已經有一波一定的比例給弱勢群眾
655,0.02623842593,0.02628472222,賴清德,包括老年人
656,0.02628472222,0.02634259259,賴清德,另外一個是我每一次去頒獎
657,0.02634259259,0.02638888889,賴清德,或是參與建築業或營造業的活動
658,0.02638888889,0.02644675926,賴清德,我都請他們能夠協助政府三個事情
659,0.02644675926,0.02648148148,賴清德,第一個是投入都更的工作
660,0.02648148148,0.02653935185,賴清德,推動內需帶動台灣經濟的發展
661,0.02653935185,0.02658564815,賴清德,第二個請他們能夠協助政府推動
662,0.02658564815,0.02662037037,賴清德,淨零轉型這個目標
663,0.02662037037,0.02665509259,賴清德,因為大概在營建業裡面
664,0.02665509259,0.02671296296,賴清德,占碳排不同的機構有不同的計算
665,0.02671296296,0.02675925926,賴清德,也有高達30%那麼高
666,0.02675925926,0.02680555556,賴清德,所以如果營建業能夠從規劃設計
667,0.02680555556,0.02685185185,賴清德,到材料到這個工法
668,0.02685185185,0.02690972222,賴清德,甚至於最後建築起來的一個低碳的標準
669,0.02690972222,0.02696759259,賴清德,是可以協助政府往淨零的方向來走
670,0.02696759259,0.02699074074,賴清德,第三個就請他們幫忙的
671,0.02699074074,0.02701388889,賴清德,就是你剛剛講的
672,0.02701388889,0.02707175926,賴清德,因為我們現在7月份到7月份為止
673,0.02707175926,0.02712962963,賴清德,65歲以上的長輩占人口的比例是17.6%
674,0.02712962963,0.0271875,賴清德,到2025年就高達20%
675,0.0271875,0.02724537037,賴清德,就會達到世界衛生組織超高零社會的標準
676,0.02724537037,0.02728009259,賴清德,那我是建議建築界營建業
677,0.02728009259,0.02732638889,賴清德,他們在規劃設計新的建案的時候
678,0.02732638889,0.02739583333,賴清德,能夠特別針對這個長者的需求來設計
679,0.02739583333,0.02743055556,賴清德,因為年紀大者他不需要那麼大
680,0.02743055556,0.0275,賴清德,他可能需要安全方便
681,0.0275,0.0275462963,賴清德,然後也能夠運用科技
682,0.0275462963,0.02760416667,賴清德,讓我們的長者可以賣掉舊的房子
683,0.02760416667,0.02765046296,賴清德,或是把舊的房子出租
684,0.02765046296,0.02774305556,賴清德,然後來買專門為這些長輩們設計的房子
685,0.02774305556,0.02775462963,賴清德,當時我不斷的
686,0.02775462963,0.02780092593,賴清德,所以未來我們會來落實這個事情
687,0.02780092593,0.02783564815,賴清德,除了我剛剛跟大家報告
688,0.02783564815,0.02791666667,賴清德,就是電梯或者是上下樓梯的設備以外
689,0.02791666667,0.02797453704,賴清德,那我們也會來推動這個高齡者住宅
690,0.02797453704,0.02800925926,主持人,好 我們的時間到了40分
691,0.02800925926,0.02804398148,主持人,華視的新聞要提問對不對

693,0.02805555556,0.02809027778,主持人,也請各位媒體朋友們提問的話
694,0.02809027778,0.028125,主持人,我們還是依照大家的順序不要用吼的
695,0.028125,0.02814814815,主持人,麥克風好 這邊華視新聞提問
696,0.02814814815,0.0281712963,記者,想請教一下怎麼看侯友宜首度鬆口
697,0.0281712963,0.02819444444,記者,他願意接受柯侯配
698,0.02819444444,0.02822916667,記者,那雖然說過去您就曾經下令團隊說
699,0.02822916667,0.02824074074,記者,要做好一對一的準備
700,0.02824074074,0.02826388889,記者,但是過去有多份民調都顯示
701,0.02826388889,0.02828703704,記者,不管是柯侯配或是侯柯配
702,0.02828703704,0.02831018519,記者,其實有很多份的民調都是
703,0.02831018519,0.02833333333,記者,支持度都是贏過您
704,0.02833333333,0.02834490741,記者,怎麼看這樣的狀況
705,0.02834490741,0.02836805556,記者,如果說柯侯整合的話
706,0.02836805556,0.0283912037,記者,對您來說會不會更難選
707,0.0283912037,0.02840277778,記者,另外就是怎麼看說
708,0.02840277778,0.02842592593,記者,柯文哲再度對您下了戰帖
709,0.02842592593,0.0284375,記者,希望您可以說清楚
710,0.0284375,0.02846064815,記者,有關深澳電廠的議題
711,0.02846064815,0.02847222222,記者,為什麼會改變興建的態度
712,0.02847222222,0.0284837963,記者,謝謝賴副
713,0.0284837963,0.02855324074,賴清德,好 就是說藍白合
714,0.02855324074,0.02858796296,賴清德,如果基於理念
715,0.02858796296,0.02864583333,賴清德,那是職務分配
716,0.02864583333,0.0287037037,賴清德,如果不是因為理念
717,0.0287037037,0.02877314815,賴清德,那他們的合就是權威的分贓
718,0.02877314815,0.0287962963,賴清德,社會其實看得很清楚
719,0.0287962963,0.02883101852,賴清德,那到底他們合不合
720,0.02883101852,0.02886574074,賴清德,我除了希望他們能夠基於理念以外
721,0.02886574074,0.02892361111,賴清德,也能夠基於自己政黨的自由意志
722,0.02892361111,0.0290162037,賴清德,不希望中國介入這場選舉
